### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Two variables provided a non-random amount of variance and are deemed to be statistically significant: vehicle length and ground clearance.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p=value is 5.35e-11, far smaller than the commonly held threshold of 0.05.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model predicts MPG effectively with a relative degree of certainty. The R-squared value of 0.7149 suggests that this linear model is ~71% accurate.
